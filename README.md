# pNES
A work in progress NES emulator created to learn about embedded systems, emulator architecture/design, performance-critical code, and how things were done back in the day when things were timed in cycles.

This project has been off and on for quite a while due to work and school. My aim is to get motivated to improve and eventually finish it by putting it online.

**What is mostly implemented:**
* CPU
* PPU
* Some basic mappers (UxROM, MMC1)

**What still needs to be done:**
* APU support
* Better timing and accuracy
* More comprehensive mapper support
* An actual UI
